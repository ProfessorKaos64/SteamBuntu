# SteamBuntu
 Steambuntu, a Ubuntu to SteamOS conversion project. Just a simple project for fun :P

# WIP !!! Please do not use.

# Plan

* Start with 16.04.1 LTS for testing
* Cut out uneeded cruft
* Replicate StemOS session using existing Ubuntu packages
* Replicate as much of the "unattended" console-like approach as possible
* Add PPA source (LibreGeek) with needed packages so they are available not just in a private repo at packages.libregeek.org (also will handle build recipes with bazaar/launchpad)
* Add PPA sources for popular drivers/GPUs
* Configure users/system to match as closely as possible
* Package everything into Ubuntu .deb packages for easily removal/tracking should user want to revert system?
